# Enhanced Data Analysis Agent

This code implements an `EnhancedDataAnalysisAgent` class that combines PySpark for data processing with an open source LLM (specifically Groq's llama3-70b model) to automate comprehensive data analysis.

## Overview

This Enhanced Data Analysis Agent acts as a comprehensive business intelligence tool that goes beyond basic data analysis. Here's what it does:

### Business Intelligence Features

The agent thoroughly analyzes your data to deliver:

- **Deep Business Insights**: It identifies patterns, trends, and anomalies in your data that have real business implications
- **Improvement Opportunities**: It pinpoints specific areas where your business can improve performance or efficiency
- **Key Success Factors**: It determines which variables most strongly influence your outcomes and should be prioritized
- **Strategic Recommendations**: It provides actionable steps your business can take based on the data findings
- **Focus Areas**: It highlights the most critical points that deserve your immediate attention

### Dynamic Agent Architecture

What makes this tool particularly powerful is its interconnected agent system:

- **Chain of Analysis**: The output from one analytical process automatically becomes the input for the next
- **Real-Time Decision Making**: The system dynamically determines what analyses to run based on what it discovers
- **Adaptive Processing**: Rather than following a rigid script, the agent adjusts its approach as insights emerge
- **Contextual Understanding**: Each agent builds upon the context established by previous analyses
- **Continuous Refinement**: Insights are progressively enhanced as they flow through the system

This creates an intelligent analysis pipeline where each component enhances the work of the others, delivering increasingly sophisticated insights without requiring manual intervention between steps.

## Key Functionality

### 1. Dataset Description Generation

The `generate_dataset_description()` method:
- Analyzes the schema of the dataset
- Sends this information to the LLM to generate:
  - Business description (domain, business processes, users, key entities)
  - Technical description (column details, relationships, data quality, transformations)

### 2. Domain-Specific Pattern Analysis

The `analyze_domain_specific_patterns()` method:
- Calculates correlations between numeric columns
- Analyzes temporal patterns (hourly, daily, monthly) for date columns
- Analyzes category distributions for categorical columns

### 3. Visualization Generation

The `generate_visualizations()` method:
- Prompts the LLM to generate code for relevant visualizations
- Explains business relevance of each visualization

### 4. Custom Analysis Execution

The `execute_custom_analysis()` method:
- Executes the visualization generation code in local environment and analyses it to understand trends, correlations and to get insights

### 5. Comprehensive Report Generation

The `generate_comprehensive_report()` method:
- Compiles all previous analyses
- Adds data quality metrics (total records, null counts, duplicates)
- Prompts the LLM to generate a structured report with:
  1. Executive summary
  2. Dataset overview
  3. Data quality assessment
  4. Key insights
  5. Visualizations
  6. Recommendations
  7. Next steps
